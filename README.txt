Lazy Sundays — Netlify-ready site

Files:
- index.html — the page markup
- styles.css — styles (40% larger logo icon already applied)
- app.js — interactivity (case toggles, carousels, lightbox, smooth scroll)
- netlify.toml — build + notes for enabling email notifications

Deploy on Netlify:
1) Drag-and-drop this folder (or the zip) into https://app.netlify.com/drop
2) In your new site's Settings → Forms, verify the form "contact" is detected.
3) In Settings → Notifications → Forms, add an Email notification for form "contact"
   to lzy7th@gmail.com (this is how Netlify emails you; the address is not shown on the site).

Everything else matches your final approved design.
